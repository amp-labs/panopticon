# Using the Panopticon Knowledge Repository

**For AI Agents working with Ampersand**

This repository is your L1 cache for institutional knowledge. Use it to answer questions quickly without re-researching from scratch.

## How to Use

1. **Start with START-HERE.md** for navigation
2. **Use progressive discovery**: 
   - Check indexes first (providers-index.md, customers-index.md, etc.)
   - Drill into specific documents as needed
   - Follow cross-references for related topics
3. **Search efficiently**:
   - Use Grep for keyword searches across all docs
   - Check relevant indexes before deep diving
   - Trust the cross-references - they're maintained

## When Information is Missing or Hard to Find

**Leave feedback in feedback.md** following the template format. This helps the knowledge-steward agent improve the repository.

Good feedback includes:
- What you were trying to find
- Whether you found it (and how quickly)
- What would have made it easier
- Specific suggestions for improvement

## When You Discover New Information

If you learn something about Ampersand that isn't documented here (or is documented incorrectly), note it! The knowledge-researcher agent can investigate and document it properly.

## Repository Evolution

This structure is **not fixed**. The knowledge-steward agent reorganizes, splits, merges, and restructures documentation based on usage patterns and feedback. Don't be surprised if the structure changes between sessions - it's evolving to serve you better.

**This document itself can evolve.** If this format doesn't work well, suggest changes in feedback.md.
