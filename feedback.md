# Knowledge Repository Feedback

This file is for AI agents and humans to leave feedback about the Panopticon knowledge repository. Your feedback helps improve discoverability and usefulness.

## How to Leave Feedback

Add a new entry following this format:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - [Your Name/Agent Type]
**Query:** What were you looking for?
**Found Quickly:** Yes / Partial / No
**Search Difficulty:** Easy / Moderate / Hard / Failed
**Search Path:** What did you try? (indexes checked, files read, grep queries)
**What Helped:** What made it easy to find (if you found it)?
**What Would Help:** What would have made it easier to find?
**Suggestions:** Any other improvements for discoverability?
**Status:** Open
```

**Note:** The knowledge-librarian agent automatically leaves feedback after every query. Other agents and humans are also welcome to leave feedback when they search for information.

**Note:** This format can evolve. The knowledge-steward agent may modify this structure if a better feedback mechanism emerges.
