# Research Tasks

This file tracks knowledge gaps, low-confidence claims, and areas needing investigation by the knowledge-researcher agent.

## How This Works

- **Knowledge-steward** identifies gaps from feedback and marks items here
- **Knowledge-researcher** picks up tasks and investigates them
- **Completed research** gets removed from this list
- **Format can evolve** based on what works best

## High Priority

_(Tasks that impact multiple agents or critical workflows)_

## Medium Priority

_(Useful but not blocking)_

## Low Priority / Nice to Have

_(Interesting but not urgent)_

## Low-Confidence Claims Needing Verification

_(Documented with 🟡 or 🔴 markers, need verification)_

**Note:** This is a living document. Priorities shift, new gaps emerge, and the structure can change as needed.
