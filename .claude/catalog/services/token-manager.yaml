facts:
- '**Centralized token refresh** -- Single point of truth for OAuth token refresh
  operations'
- '**Race condition prevention** -- Serializes concurrent token refresh requests'
- '**TLS/mTLS support** -- Supports disabled, enabled, and mutual TLS modes'
- '**Token caching** -- Reduces redundant refresh calls'
- '`routes/route.go` -- Route registration'
