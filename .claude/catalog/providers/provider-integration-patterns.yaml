facts:
- The server **automatically reads** the latest catalog from GitHub (no server redeploy
  needed)
- Catalog is **refreshed every 30 minutes** in production
- Can be overridden via `PROVIDER_CATALOG_URL` environment variable
- Falls back to the compiled-in catalog if the remote fetch fails
- Provider name and display metadata
