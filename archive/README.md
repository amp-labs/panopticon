# Feedback Archive

This directory contains archived feedback entries from `feedback.md`.

## Organization

- **feedback-archive-YYYY-QN.md** - Quarterly archives of closed feedback entries
- Entries are moved here when they're older than 30 days and marked as Closed
- Preserves historical patterns for future analysis by steward/champion agents

## Why Archive?

- Prevents unbounded growth of feedback.md
- Keeps feedback.md focused on recent/actionable items
- Maintains searchable history of what worked/didn't work over time
- Enables pattern analysis for repository improvements

## Usage

Archived feedback is read-only historical record. Active feedback belongs in `feedback.md`.
